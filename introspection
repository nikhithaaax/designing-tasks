Introduction 

Hello , Iam Nikhitha Peethala from AI-B section. I come from a background that's not particularly focused on technology or programming, but the power and creativity behind coding have always fascinated me. Over time, I've realized that coding is more than just lines of text â€“ it's a language that empowers us to create, problem-solve, and shape the digital world.

Future aspirations:
For the next 6 months I wanna upskill my knowledge in coding areas. As I continue my coding journey, I have a clear goal in mind: to be able to build functional and creative applications that have a positive impact. Whether it's a simple website or a more complex program, I'm dedicated to honing my skills and making meaningful contributions through code.
